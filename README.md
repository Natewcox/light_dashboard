I already loaded examples using the pins needed to control relay board. Under Dashboard on the right pull down list. you will see the above. Clicking layout, you can move all the dashboard items where you want them. Once it's like you want it, in a browser on the same network, ipaddress:1880/ui and you are ready to go. Keep in mind that the relays are rated for 10amps so limit it to 8amps. Pretty easy to do if LEDs.
### Other references
Look at my Dashboard repo. I will try to finish it this weekend. It has a whole lot more details. The other repo's are the controls I am using for my garage and my heater. They are good examples for advance usage of Node-red and how to install everything. 
# Good Luck
